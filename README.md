# About

Im (personally) using OpenBSD since 2012. From time to time people ask me
why I'm using it. Why it's so great?

I often struggle having all the informations, all the tiny bits of
informations in my head, explaining them to people asking. The technical
stuff, innovations, behaviour and so on.

The idea is to create a website that shows cool stuff (facts) to people 
interested in OpenBSD

# Help!

Everyone is free to create a PR and this project relies on help! Im not an expert on 
everything and facts may be missing, have typos or are wrong. 

Feel free to open PRs for:

* New facts
* Fix typos
* Add additional references to existing facts
* Layout / CSS / HTML changes
* Correct claims in fact descriptions
* Everything else you can think of
