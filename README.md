# About

Im (personally) using OpenBSD since 2012. From time to time people ask me
why I'm using it. Why it's so great?

I often struggle having all the informations, all the tiny bits of
informations in my head, explaining them to people asking. The technical
stuff, innovations, behaviour and so on.

The idea is to create a website that shows cool stuff (facts) to people interested in OpenBSD

Help spreading informations and facts about how great OpenBSD is.
