title: "Xserver without root permissions"
---

OpenBSD developers worked hard to make this possible. Since 2014, X no longer
requires special privileges and can be run as a user instead of as root.

Details:

* [Xorg can now run without privilege on OpenBSD](https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&sid=20140223112426)
* [CVS: cvs.openbsd.org: xenocara](https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&;m=139245772023497&w=2)
