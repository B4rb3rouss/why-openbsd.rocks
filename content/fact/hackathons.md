title: "Hackathons"
---

June 1999 is first time when a group of OpenBSD developers met in one space to began working on cryptographic code. Now,
hackathons for OpenBSD take place three to four times a year and cover a varity of improvements to the codebase.
Hackathons are available to developers, or invite only, and held all over the word.

Funding for hackathons is made possible by donations from people like you. Consider donating to the
OpenBSD Foundation to continue funding for these events.
