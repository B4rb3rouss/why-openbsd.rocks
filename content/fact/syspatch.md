title: "syspatch(8)"
---

A common mistake is that you need to patch and recompile OpenBSD manually
when security updates need to happen. OpenBSD supports binary patches since
6.1 using its own tooling `syspatch(8)`! Binary updates are available for amd64, i386,
and arm64 for the current and previous version of OpenBSD.

Consider subscribing to the announce mailing list to be informed of security
updates.

* [syspatch(8) - OpenBSD manual pages](https://man.openbsd.org/syspatch)
