title: "syspatch(8)"
---

A common mistake is that you need to patch and recompile OpenBSD manually
when security updates need to happen. OpenBSD supports binary patches since
6.1 using its own tooling `syspatch(8)`!

Details:

* [OpenBSD 6.1](https://www.openbsd.org/61.html)
* [syspatch(8) - OpenBSD manual pages](https://man.openbsd.org/syspatch)
